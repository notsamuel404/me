(Q1) A class Shift contains a two-dimensional integer array of order (m√ón) where the maximum values of both m and n are 5. Design the class Shift to shuffle the matrix (i.e. the first row becomes the last, the second row becomes the first and so on).

Example 1:
output:- Enter elements
input:- 2
        3
        13
        5
output:- 2	3	
         13	5
         13     5
         2      3
